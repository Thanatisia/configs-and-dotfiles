# Dotfile Repository #
######################

Hello everyone, this is my repo for dotfile storage management.
Basically - this repository contains all dotfiles, configs according to specific profiles
(i.e. ArchLinux-1 Asura) etc.

This is just for fun, typically rice - feel free to use if you like and do give me your feedback
on what you think I can improve in my rice, provide some good projects (i.e. cli-visualizer, neofetch etc.)  and/or even better - please do feel free to provide your rice.

Many thanks and hope you enjoy!
